# Java Koans 

Programming, like any other skill you wish to master, requires large amounts of exposure and practice with its concepts. During this training you may come to realize that we move rapidly through the content, and this may leave you feeling uncomfortable as we move to another topic while you are still tightening your grasp of the previous one. For instance, we will go through the base syntactic rules and core logical constructs in the Java language as a part of the first week of training. Many of you will not gain mastery of the language by the beginning of second week. That is not the expectation; the expectation is that you are making steady progress through the core concepts and taking opportunities to practice and apply what you know. This assignment offers one vector of study that you are encouraged to explore.

Koans are a paradoxical anecdote or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment. The programming world has borrowed this concept and co-opted it to benefit new programming language learners and help them understand core language concepts and syntax. By working your way through this assignment, you will gain extra exposure and be able to practice with concepts we have discussed together, as well as get exposure to some new concepts not covered explicitly within the training. Practice daily and diligently! The expectation of you for this assignment is that you work through it at your own pace, aiming to complete all of the exercises by the end of the training.



Running Instructions:
=====================
1. Clone this repository to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/220207-java-enterprise/java-koans.git` in a directory of your choosing.
2. Open a terminal and cd into the cloned repository directory and the `java-koan` directory contained within it: `cd assignments/java-koans`
3. Within it you'll find:
  - *koans*: this directory contains the application and its lessons, it is all that is needed to advance through the koans themselves and **it can be distributed independently**
  - *lib*: this directory contains the code the koans engine is comprised of and built with
  - *gradle*: wrapper for build library used to build koans source, setup project files in eclipse/idea, run tests, etc. you probably don't need to touch anything in here
* Change directory to the koans directory: `cd koans`
* If you are using Windows enter: `run.bat` or `./run.sh` if you are using Mac or Linux

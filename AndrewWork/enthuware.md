# Reoccurring Enthuware Assignment

The Enthuware is a certification study tool that helps learners prepare the Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer SE 8 (1Z0-808) certification. This certification proves competency with the syntax and core concepts to the Java language. As we proceed through through the training we will find ourselves focusing more and more on other tools, libraries, and frameworks - and less so on the low-level syntax of the language. However, this is not to imply that those concepts are less important, so in order to help you build your skills with the Java language you will be required to complete one Enthuware practice exam each week. Proof of completion is provided as a screenshot of your exam results (as much detail as it shows, please). 

## Where to get the Enthuware?

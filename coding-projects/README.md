# Project: Rectangle

**Rectangle Class**

<p>Define a Rectangle class with three variables: name, length and width. You may declare
them to be of type string and int. Also include the following in your class:</p>

* Constructor with three arguments to set the name, length and width of the rectangle
object.
* Getter and setter methods for the name, length and the width.
* Get area and get perimeter functions.

**Comparator class for comparing rectangles by area**

<p>This class will have only one member function isLessThan which will receive two
rectangle objects as argument. It will compare the rectangle objects by area and will
return a boolean value.</p>

**Comparator class for comparing rectangles by perimeter**

<p>This class will have only one member function isLessThan which will receive two
rectangle objects as argument. It will compare the rectangle objects by perimeter and will
return a boolean value.</p>

**Main Class**

<p>This will contain the main function as well as findMax function. It will:</p>

* It will create ten rectangle objects and add them to a list. You can either create
rectangles with random length and width or ask user for the length and width of
each of the rectangle.
* Display a list of all the rectangles (one rectangle per line)
* Instantiate an object of comparator class for comparing rectangles by area. Use
the findMax template function to find the largest rectangle by area and display the
result.
* Instantiate an object of comparator class for comparing rectangles by perimeter.
Use the findMax template function to find the largest rectangle by perimeter and
display the result.
